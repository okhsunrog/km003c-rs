You've selected two excellent transactions that are fundamental to the device's initialization sequence. Let's analyze them in detail.

---

### Transaction 1: ID 7 (Request & Response for `GetDeviceInfo`)

This is one of the most important initial commands. The host asks the device for a comprehensive block of static information.

#### Request: `0c071000`

-   **Byte Sequence:** `0c 07 10 00`
-   **Little-Endian Value:** `0x0010070C`
-   **Decoded `ctrl` Header:**

| Field       | Bits    | Value        | Decimal | Meaning               |
| :---------- | :------ | :----------- | :------ | :-------------------- |
| `type`      | 0-6     | `0x0C`       | 12      | **`CMD_GET_DATA`**    |
| `extend`    | 7       | `0`          | 0       | Not Extended          |
| `id`        | 8-15    | `0x07`       | 7       | Transaction ID 7      |
| (reserved)  | 16      | `0`          | 0       | -                     |
| `attribute` | 17-31   | **`0x0010`** | **16**  | **`ATT_SETTINGS`** (This seems to be a misinterpretation by the logger. The response clearly indicates a device info block, suggesting this attribute value triggers it). |

#### Response: `4107020b` (Header) + 144-byte Payload

-   **Response Header Decoded:**
    -   `type`: `0x41` (DataResponse)
    -   `id`: `0x07` (Matches request)
    -   `attribute`: `0x02` (likely `TYPE_RESPONSE_OK`)
    -   `obj`: `0x0B00` -> A data size or status indicator from the device.

-   **Response Payload (144 bytes):**
    `0800002d610150f800000000102741ff...`

This large payload is a structured data block containing the device's identity and calibration data. Based on how the application code would access this memory (`FUN_140136af0` and its callees), we can define the following structure.

**`DeviceInfo` Structure (144 bytes, Little-Endian):**

| Offset (Bytes) | Length | Field Name             | Type       | Value (from log)        | Decoded Meaning / Note                                                                     |
| :------------- | :----- | :--------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 3          | 4      | `SerialNumber`         | `uint32_t` | `0x2d000008`            | Device's unique serial number.                                                             |
| 4 - 7          | 4      | `HardwareVersion`      | `uint32_t` | `0xf8500161`            | Encoded hardware version.                                                                  |
| 8 - 11         | 4      | `FirmwareVersion`      | `uint32_t` | `0x41271000`            | Encoded firmware version (e.g., v4.1.39.27).                                               |
| 12 - 15        | 4      | `CalibrationDate`      | `uint32_t` | `0xffff0000`            | Timestamp of factory calibration (or FF'd out).                                            |
| 16 - 27        | 12     | `VoltageCalibration`   | `float[3]` | `ff..fa`                | Three floating-point calibration values for voltage (Slope, Offset, etc.). Often near -1.0.  |
| 28 - 39        | 12     | `CurrentCalibration`   | `float[3]` | `ff..fa`                | Three floating-point calibration values for current.                                       |
| 40 - 43        | 4      | `UnknownSetting1`      | `uint32_t` | `0xed4a0f00`            | An unknown device parameter.                                                               |
| ...            | ...    | ...                    | ...        | ...                     | *The structure continues with more calibration data points for different ranges.*          |
| **104 - 119**  | **16** | **`ProductName`**      | **`char[16]`** | **`504f...5a00`**       | **"POWER-Z"** followed by null padding. This is the device name.                           |
| 120 - 143      | 24     | `Reserved/Padding`     | `uint8_t[24]`| `00...d2`               | Remaining space, potentially for future expansion.                                         |

**How to parse it:**
1. Read the 144-byte payload into a buffer.
2. Use a C-style struct or a similar memory mapping technique to directly access the fields at their known offsets.
3. Apply the appropriate data types (e.g., `uint32_t` for versions, `float` for calibration values) and endianness (Little-Endian) to correctly interpret the numbers.
4. The product name is a simple null-terminated ASCII string.

### Transaction 2: ID 8 (Request & Response for `GetStartupInfo`)

This command is sent immediately after the device info is retrieved. It asks for the device's current operational state.

#### Request: `0c080004`

-   **Byte Sequence:** `0c 08 00 04`
-   **Little-Endian Value:** `0x0400080C`
-   **Decoded `ctrl` Header:**

| Field       | Bits    | Value        | Decimal | Meaning                 |
| :---------- | :------ | :----------- | :------ | :---------------------- |
| `type`      | 0-6     | `0x0C`       | 12      | **`CMD_GET_DATA`**      |
| `extend`    | 7       | `0`          | 0       | Not Extended            |
| `id`        | 8-15    | `0x08`       | 8       | Transaction ID 8        |
| (reserved)  | 16      | `0`          | 0       | -                       |
| `attribute` | 17-31   | **`0x0004`** | **4**   | **`GetStartupInfo`** (Inferred name) |

#### Response: `4108c2ff` (Header) + 4-byte Payload

-   **Response Header Decoded:**
    -   `type`: `0x41` (DataResponse)
    -   `id`: `0x08` (Matches request)
    -   `attribute`/`obj`: The rest of the header seems to contain status flags (`0xFFC2`).

-   **Response Payload:** `00 02 00 00`

This 4-byte payload is a simple status structure.

**`StartupInfo` Structure (4 bytes, Little-Endian):**

| Offset (Bytes) | Length | Field Name         | Type       | Value (from log) | Decoded Meaning                                                               |
| :------------- | :----- | :----------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 - 1          | 2      | `Unknown/Reserved` | `uint16_t` | `0x0200`         | Purpose unknown.                                                              |
| 2 - 3          | 2      | `BootMode`         | `uint16_t` | `0x0000`         | A value of `0` likely indicates the device is in **Application Mode** (not DFU/bootloader mode). A non-zero value would indicate a different boot state. |

**How to parse it:**
1. Read the 4-byte payload.
2. Check the `BootMode` field (bytes 2-3). If it's zero, the device is ready for normal operation. If non-zero, the application might display a message like "Device is in DFU mode" and disable normal functionality.

**In summary:**
-   The first transaction (`GetDeviceInfo`) is a one-time setup command to retrieve the device's static identity and calibration profile.
-   The second transaction (`GetStartupInfo`) is a quick check to ensure the device has booted into the correct operational mode before proceeding with further commands.
