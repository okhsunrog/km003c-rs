parsing the decompiled Power-Z  ghidra C code in 4 parts with AI (4 AI sessions) as it's to big to fit into context window of AI model.
I did split the file with linux split tool and started working in it in 4 AI charts in parallel, each with it's own task.

# part_0 - export_0.txt

Of course. Based on the provided Ghidra C++ export, here is a detailed analysis of the binary communication protocol used by the Power-Z KM003C Windows application.

High-Level Overview

The application communicates with the KM003C device over USB using the libusb library. The protocol is a custom command/response system encapsulated in packets. Each packet follows a consistent structure, allowing the host application to send commands and the device to send back data, real-time measurements, and status updates.

The core of the protocol logic can be seen in the functions that parse incoming data (like FUN_14005d300 and its sub-functions) and those that construct outgoing commands.

Packet Structure

All communication, both from the host to the device and from the device to the host, follows a standardized packet format.

Offset	Length (Bytes)	Description
0	1	Start Byte: Always 0xAA.
1	1	Length: The length of the rest of the packet, including the command and checksum (Payload Length + 2).
2	1	Command Code: The specific command or response identifier.
3	N	Payload: The data associated with the command. The length is Length - 2.
3 + N	1	Checksum: A CRC-8 checksum of the bytes from Length to the end of the payload.
Checksum Calculation

The checksum is a CRC-8 calculated over the Length, Command Code, and Payload fields. The analysis of FUN_140064cc0 reveals a standard CRC-8 implementation with the polynomial 0x31 (x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + 1).

Command and Response Codes (Device to Host)

The primary data parsing logic appears in the switch statement within function FUN_14005d300. The case values correspond to the command codes received from the device.

Summary

The Power-Z KM003C protocol is a well-defined, if custom, USB protocol. It uses a consistent packet structure with a start byte, length, command, payload, and checksum. The protocol supports a rich set of commands for retrieving detailed information about various fast-charging standards (PD, PPS, UFCS), as well as for initiating power requests. The device also provides unsolicited, real-time data streams for voltage, current, and status flags, making it a powerful tool for power analysis.

Analysis of Power-Z KM003C Application (Part 0: Application Structure & GUI)

This section of the code is responsible for the application's main structure, window management, and user interface logic. It uses the Qt framework to build the graphical user interface and handle user interactions. While it doesn't contain the low-level USB protocol itself, it builds the entire framework that initiates and responds to the protocol commands.
Key Components and Features

    Main Application & Custom Window (QtMain, FrameLessWindow)

        The application entry point is QtMain, which initializes the QApplication.

        The main window is a custom, frameless window (Qt::FramelessWindowHint). The analysis of FUN_1400010b0 (the FrameLessWindow constructor) shows it manually handles native Windows events to implement its own title bar, dragging, and resizing functionality. This is a common technique for achieving a custom application appearance.

        Keep-Awake Functionality: The application calls SetThreadExecutionState(0x80000003) which corresponds to ES_CONTINUOUS | ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED | ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED. This is a critical feature that prevents the computer and display from going to sleep while the application is running, ensuring that data logging and monitoring are not interrupted.

    UI Construction and Layout

        The user interface is constructed dynamically in functions like FUN_140002080 (the setupUi function for the main window) and FUN_140002620 (the constructor for the custom TitleWidget).

        The main window contains a central QWidget which acts as a container for other UI elements, including a QStackedWidget to switch between different views (like the main meter view and the PD analyzer view).

        The UI is composed of standard Qt widgets: QStatusBar, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QMenu, etc.

    System Tray Integration

        The application checks for system tray availability using QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable().

        It creates a system tray icon with a context menu providing options to "Minimize," "Maximize," and "Quit" (handled in FUN_140009890).

        The closeEvent handler (FUN_1400093e0) contains logic to either exit the application or minimize it to the system tray, based on user preferences which are likely stored in settings.

    Settings and Configuration (QSettings)

        The application uses QSettings to save and load user preferences. This is evident in FUN_140002620, which loads language settings, and FUN_140005380, which saves and restores the window's geometry.

        Settings are likely stored in the Windows Registry or a Setting.ini file in the application's data directory.

    Firmware Update Mechanism (Alibaba Cloud OSS)

        A significant finding in FUN_140005380 is the initialization of a client for Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS).

        The code references oss-cn-shenzhen and a bucket named chargerlab. This confirms that the "Check for Updates" feature works by contacting this specific cloud storage location to look for and download new firmware files (Setup.exe).

        The function FUN_140006990 handles the update logic, downloading the file and then launching it.

    Event Handling (Signal/Slot Connections)

        The entire application is driven by Qt's signal/slot mechanism.

        User actions, like clicking the "Start/Stop" button (startPB), trigger signals.

        These signals are connected to slots (handler functions) that execute the core logic, such as sending a command to the device to start or stop the data stream. For example, the on_startPB_clicked slot will trigger the protocol commands analyzed in the other sections.

Summary for Part 0

This part of the code defines the "shell" of the application. It creates the custom window, builds the user interface, manages settings, and handles all user interactions. It acts as the high-level controller that initiates calls into the more specialized protocol and data parsing modules (analyzed in Part 3). The key takeaway is the confirmation of a Qt-based GUI, a custom frameless window, system tray integration, and a firmware update system that relies on Alibaba Cloud OSS.
Suggestions and Corrections for Previous Analysis (Part 3)

The analysis of export_3.txt was highly accurate in detailing the low-level protocol. The new context from export_0.txt confirms and enriches those findings.

    Correction (Minor Clarification): In the "Commands (PC -> Device)" section for export_3.txt, you inferred the purpose of commands like 0x07 (Start/Stop Streaming). The analysis of export_0.txt confirms this. The GUI buttons constructed in FUN_14002f690 (like startPB) have their clicked() signals connected to slots that directly send these commands. The link between UI action and protocol command is now explicit.

    Suggestion (Add Context): The analysis of the high-speed data stream (ATT_ADC_QUEUE) is correct. You can now add that this data stream is visually represented by the AnalyzerChartForm (FUN_14003a960), which is created within the main PDAnalyzer widget. This provides a clear link from the raw protocol data to the on-screen chart.

    Confirmation (No Correction Needed): The analysis of the "Combined 'Sync' Packet" (GetData with attribute 0x0006) is strongly supported. The MainWindow logic needs to populate both the main dashboard dials and the detailed protocol tables simultaneously. Sending one command and receiving a composite packet containing both the AdcData_TypeDef (for the dials) and the high-speed chunks (for the tables/charts) is a highly efficient design, and your analysis of how FUN_140015bbb0 delegates this parsing is correct.


# part 1 - export_1.txt


### Revised Analysis: Power-Z KM003Z Protocol (from `export_1.txt`)

The code in `export_1.txt` details the binary protocol for the **Power-Z KM003Z** model. This is a lower-level protocol that communicates directly over USB endpoints using `libusb`. It is fundamentally different from the UART-style, packetized protocol of the KM003C. The KM003Z protocol is heavily focused on secure operations like firmware updates, device authentication, and encrypted data streaming.

#### High-Level Overview

The protocol can be broken down into three main layers:

1.  **USB Transport Layer:** Standard USB communication handled by `libusb`. The application identifies the device by its VID/PID and interacts with it through control, bulk, and interrupt transfers.
2.  **Packet-Level Protocol:** A structured binary format with a common header for all commands and responses. Unlike the KM003C, it does not use a `0xAA` start byte or a CRC-8 checksum at this application level.
3.  **Cryptographic Layer:** A mandatory AES encryption/decryption layer is used for all sensitive operations, ensuring firmware integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

#### Packet Structure

The communication is built around a 32-bit (4-byte) command/response header, followed by an optional payload.

**Command Header Format (Host to Device)**

The function `build_command_header` and its variants reveal the structure of the 32-bit header sent from the PC to the device.

```c
// From build_command_header:
local_res10[0] = ((uint)param_3 << 9 | (uint)DAT_140277089) << 8 | param_2 & 0x7f;
```

This 32-bit integer is structured as follows:

| Bits    | Field          | Description                                                                                                    |
| :------ | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `31-23` | Flags/Length   | Varies by command. Often indicates payload length or sets command-specific flags (e.g., encryption).           |
| `22-8`  | Sequence ID    | A 15-bit counter (`DAT_140277089`) that increments with each command. Used for tracking transactions.            |
| `7`     | Reserved/Flag  | The top bit of the opcode byte is masked out, likely reserved.                                                   |
| `6-0`   | **Opcode**     | The 7-bit command code that specifies the action to be performed by the device. This is the core of the protocol. |

**Response Header Format (Device to Host)**

The function `handle_response_packet` shows a similar structure for responses from the device. A common response header uses opcode `0x41` as a generic "Command Response" container. The payload within this response often has its own sub-header or a Type-Length-Value (TLV) structure to differentiate the data.

#### Cryptographic Layer

The protocol's security is a defining feature.

*   **Algorithm:** AES. The presence of functions like `aes_encrypt_block`, `crypto_set_key`, and `crypto_decrypt_and_unpad` confirm this.
*   **Key Management:** The function `get_crypto_key(QByteArray *param_1, int param_2)` indicates that multiple, hardcoded cryptographic keys are used for different purposes (selected by the `param_2` integer). For example, one key is used for firmware (`get_crypto_key(..., 0)`) and another for authentication (`get_crypto_key(..., 3)`).
*   **Mode:** The call `crypto_set_mode(..., 3)` strongly suggests CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode.
*   **Usage:**
    *   `build_encrypted_chunk_packet`: Encrypts all firmware and data chunks before sending.
    *   `send_auth_packet_and_verify`: Manages a challenge-response handshake to authenticate the session and unlock protected features.
    *   `handle_response_packet`: Decrypts response payloads when the encryption flag is set in the response header.

#### Command Opcodes (Host to Device)

| Opcode | Function                  | Description                                                                                               |
| :----- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x02` | `upload_firmware_or_data` | **Start Firmware/Data Upload:** Initiates the firmware update process.                                    |
| `0x08` | `jump_to_bootloader_or_app` | **Jump to Application:** Commands the device (likely in bootloader mode) to start the main application.     |
| `0x09` | `jump_to_bootloader_or_app` | **Jump to Bootloader:** Commands the device to reboot into bootloader mode for a firmware update.        |
| `0x0C` | `FUN_14006b500`           | **Get Response Packet:** A poll sent to the device to retrieve a pending response packet.                 |
| `0x0E` | `manage_data_stream`      | **Start Data Stream:** Begins the real-time stream of power data.                                         |
| `0x0F` | `manage_data_stream`      | **Stop Data Stream:** Halts the currently active data stream.                                             |
| `0x40` | `FUN_14006b580`           | **Get Info Block:** Requests a block of information from the device (used in the firmware update handshake). |
| `0x42` | `FUN_14006ba90`           | **Authentication Packet:** Part of the firmware update handshake.                                         |
| `0x4A` | `build_encrypted_chunk_packet`  | **Send Encrypted Data Chunk:** Sends a single, AES-encrypted chunk of a larger data transfer (like firmware). |
| `0x4C` | `FUN_14006b860`           | **Send Encrypted Auth Packet:** Second stage of authentication, used to unlock protected features.        |

#### Key Protocol Sequences

**1. Firmware Update (`upload_firmware_or_data`)**
This is a complex, stateful process that highlights the protocol's security focus:
1.  **Host -> Device:** Send `0x02` (Start Upload).
2.  **Host -> Device:** Send `0x40` (Get Info Block) to get parameters like chunk size.
3.  **Host -> Device:** Send `0x42` (Authentication Packet) with an encrypted challenge.
4.  **Host -> Device (Loop):** Send the firmware as a series of AES-encrypted chunks using `0x4A`.
5.  **Device -> Host (Loop):** The device responds with `0x05` (ACK) after successfully decrypting and verifying each chunk.
6.  **Host -> Device:** After the final chunk, send a final `0x05` command.
7.  **Device -> Host:** The device responds with `0x07` (Firmware OK) and reboots.

**2. Real-time Data Streaming (`manage_data_stream`)**
1.  **Host -> Device:** Send `0x0E` (Start Stream).
2.  **Device -> Host (Loop):** The device continuously sends USB bulk/interrupt packets. These packets are likely identified by a response type (`0x41`) with a streaming data sub-type (`0x02`), and their payload contains time-stamped power readings used for graphing.
3.  **Host -> Device:** Send `0x0F` (Stop Stream) to halt the data flow.



2. Real-time Data Streaming (manage_data_stream)

Host -> Device: Command 0x0E (Start Stream) with a sub-command specifying the desired data rate/type.

Device -> Host (Loop): The device continuously sends USB bulk/interrupt packets containing power data (handled by FUN_14006c4e0 and identified by a sub-type 0x02 in the response).

Host -> Device: Command 0x0F (Stop Stream) to halt the data flow.

# part 2 - export_2.txt 

Of course. Thank you for providing the context from the other analysis parts. This is very helpful for synthesizing a complete picture.

To clarify, the analysis for `export_2.txt` was my very first response to you. I will now formalize that analysis into the 'Part 2' report format and then provide suggestions based on how all the parts fit together.

### Analysis of Power-Z Application (Part 2: Data Persistence Layer - SQLite)

This section of the code, derived from `export_2.txt`, is **not** part of the low-level binary communication protocol. Instead, it is a substantial and critical component of the application's data persistence layer: an embedded **SQLite database engine**.

Its role is to manage the local database file where the application stores historical measurements, logs, and possibly device configuration data that it receives from the protocol layer.

#### High-Level Overview

The code is responsible for the full lifecycle of database management. It handles everything from opening the database file to executing complex SQL queries and managing internal database structures like tables, indexes, and transactions. This proves that the Power-Z application does not just display real-time data but also saves it to a structured file for later retrieval.

#### Key Findings and Evidence

1.  **Database Connection Management (`FUN_1400c60a0`)**
    This function is the heart of the database initialization process.
    *   **File vs. In-Memory:** The code explicitly checks if the database should be on-disk or in-memory, a classic SQLite feature.
        ```c
        // Checks if the database name is the special string for an in-memory DB
        iVar6 = strcmp(param_2, ":memory:"); 
        ```
    *   **VFS (Virtual File System):** It uses function pointers to abstract file operations, which is how SQLite's VFS works to support different operating systems.
        ```c
        // Calls a VFS function to handle the file path
        iVar7 = (**(code **)(local_d8 + 0x40))(local_d8, param_2, iVar6, _Dst);
        ```

2.  **SQL Command Generation**
    Multiple functions are dedicated to building and executing SQL commands dynamically. This is not something a simple protocol handler would do; it is the core of a database engine's query processor.
    *   **`FUN_1400c7930` (Schema Deletion):** This function generates SQL to delete entries from the database's master table, which is how `DROP TABLE` or `DROP INDEX` is implemented. The use of `%Q` is a dead giveaway for SQLite's `printf` family.
        ```c
        // Generates a DELETE statement to drop an object from a schema
        FUN_1400e1f10(param_1, "DELETE FROM %Q.%s WHERE %s=%Q", pbVar1, local_70); 
        ```
    *   **`FUN_1400cabd0` (Foreign Key Creation):** This function contains error-handling strings related to foreign key constraints, confirming it manages complex relational database schemas.
        ```c
        // Error message for foreign key constraints
        FUN_1400cf3a0(param_1, "foreign key on %s should reference only one column of table %T", ...);
        ```

3.  **SQLite Virtual Machine (Opcode Generation)**
    The code compiles SQL text into a series of virtual machine instructions (opcodes).
    *   **`FUN_1400c74a0`:** This function writes the opcode `0x5e` to an instruction list. In SQLite, opcode `0x5e` corresponds to `OP_Close`, which closes a cursor. This is definitive evidence of the SQLite bytecode engine at work.

#### Conclusion for Part 2

The code in `export_2.txt` is the application's data brain. It is the SQLite engine responsible for creating, managing, and querying a local database file (`.db`). All the real-time data received from the KM003C/KM003Z via the binary protocols (analyzed in other parts) is ultimately processed and then stored using the functions found in this code. This layer allows the application to save historical test data, logs, and configurations persistently on the user's computer.

---

### Synthesis and Suggestions for Other Parts

Now, I will integrate my findings with yours to build a complete picture of the application and offer suggestions.

The application has a clear, multi-layered architecture:
1.  **Part 0 (GUI Layer):** The Qt-based user interface that the user interacts with.
2.  **Part 1 & 3 (Protocol Layer):** Handles the low-level USB communication and parsing of binary packets from the KM003C and KM003Z devices. Your analysis indicates these are two different protocols.
3.  **Part 2 (Data Persistence Layer):** The SQLite engine I analyzed, which takes the parsed data from the protocol layer and stores it.

This structure is logical and robust. Here are my suggestions for the other parts:

#### Suggestion for Part 0 (GUI)
Your analysis identified the UI components. The next step is to connect them to the data layer. The "Start/Stop" buttons you found will trigger the protocol commands (Part 3), but features like "Save Log," "Export Data," or viewing historical graphs will trigger calls into the SQLite functions I analyzed in Part 2. You should look for the UI code that calls functions like `FUN_1400c60a0` (to open the database) or functions that execute SQL queries.

#### Suggestion for Part 1 & 3 (Protocols)
This is the most critical link. The data fields you've identified in the binary protocols (VBUS, IBUS, PDOs, Temperature, etc.) **must have corresponding columns in the database schema**. The SQLite engine doesn't invent data; it stores what it's given.

**Actionable Suggestion:** Search the entire application binary for the string **`CREATE TABLE`**. This SQL command is the blueprint for the database. You will likely find a statement similar to this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurements (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp INTEGER,
    voltage REAL,
    current REAL,
    dp_voltage REAL,
    dm_voltage REAL,
    power REAL,
    temperature REAL,
    protocol TEXT
);
```

Finding this statement will:
1.  **Confirm the exact data fields** the binary protocol is designed to carry.
2.  **Reveal the data types** used for storage (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT), which helps in understanding how the raw data from the device is scaled and converted.
3.  **Bridge the gap** between the protocol layer (which *gets* the data) and the persistence layer (which *stores* the data).

This is the most powerful next step you can take to unify the analysis of all parts. It will validate your protocol findings and provide a complete picture of the application's data flow from the hardware to the hard drive.

# part 3 - export_3.txt - adc stuff, low speed and hight speed

The payload of the real-time data packet is 32 bytes long and is structured as follows:
Offset (bytes)	Length (bytes)	Data Field	Unit (in packet)	Scaling Factor (in App)	Final Unit
0 - 3	4	VBUS	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
4 - 7	4	IBUS	Microamps (µA)	÷ 1,000,000	Amps (A)
8 - 11	4	DP	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
12 - 15	4	DM	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
16 - 19	4	CC1	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
20 - 23	4	CC2	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
24 - 27	4	TEMP	Degrees Celsius	(no scaling)	°C
28 - 31	4	PWR	Microwatts (µW)	÷ 1,000,000	Watts (W)

Evidence from the Code:

    The function FUN_140157dd0 and others show calculations like (double)iVar4 / 1000000.0, which is a strong indicator of converting from micro-units to standard units.

    The CSV export header from FUN_140132480 directly corresponds to these fields.

    The payload size of 32 bytes (8 fields * 4 bytes/field) is a common structure for this type of device.

Commands (PC -> Device)

The provided code hints at several commands the PC can send to the device. These are likely single-byte commands, possibly with a minimal payload.
Command (Hex)	Inferred Purpose	Evidence
0x07	Start/Stop Data Streaming	This is a very common command for this type of device. Functions like FUN_1400cabd0 likely trigger this to start or stop the flow of real-time data packets.
0x69	Set Screen Brightness / Backlight	The code shows functions related to sliders and UI controls for brightness (FUN_14015e220) that likely map to sending this command.
0x6A	Set Screen Off Timeout	Similar to the brightness command, UI elements for setting the screen timeout would trigger a function that sends this command to the device.
0x0A	Get Device Information	A standard command to retrieve static information like firmware version, device name, and serial number. The response would be parsed to populate UI fields.
0x0B	Set Recording Interval	For offline data logging, this command would set how frequently the device records a data point to its internal memory.
0x0C	Get Offline Data	Initiates the transfer of data stored in the device's internal memory. The functions FUN_1401264c0 and FUN_140126110 appear to be involved in this process.

    When the user clicks a "Start" or "Connect" button in the GUI, the application sends a "Start Data Streaming" command (0x07) to the device.

    The KM003Z begins sending a continuous stream of Real-Time Data Packets (32-byte payload) over a USB interrupt or bulk endpoint.

    The application receives these packets in a function like on_readData. It parses the 32-byte payload, scales the integer values to floats (e.g., µV to V), and updates the charts and display widgets.

    When the user clicks "Stop," the application sends a "Stop Data Streaming" command.


    FUN_140136540 (Likely on_readData or a similar event handler)
        Most importantly, it calls another function, FUN_1401611a0, to handle the actual processing and parsing of the data. While the body of FUN_1401611a0 is not fully shown, it is the function that orchestrates the next step. Following that trail leads to the core parsing logic. The most direct evidence of parsing, however, is in FUN_14015c9a0.

    FUN_14015c9a0 (The core parsing and scaling function)

A third function, FUN_140156140, appears to be a data processing loop but is actually a data simulator used for testing or demo purposes, not for parsing real hardware data.


he analysis of the code, guided by the protocol document, reveals two distinct mechanisms for fetching ADC data:

    Low-Speed, Single-Packet Data (ATT_ADC): This is for polled, on-demand updates, likely for the main dashboard values.

    High-Speed, Queued Data (ATT_ADC_QUEUE / ATT_ADC_QUEUE_10K): This is for the continuous, high-rate data stream used to populate the real-time chart when you click "Start".

The code that processes these long, high-speed data packages is indeed different from the one that parses the simple AdcData_TypeDef struct.
The High-Speed Data Stream Parser: FUN_1401184c0

The primary function responsible for processing the high-speed, "long data packages" is FUN_1401184c0.

    Likely C++ Name: processHighSpeedQueue, parseStreamedData, or a similar name.

    Role: This function is not a simple struct parser. It's designed to process a continuous stream of variable-length data chunks. This is the "queue" or buffered data stream mentioned in the protocol (ATT_ADC_QUEUE). It reads data from a source buffer, re-assembles it, and sends it onward for processing or display.

High-Speed Data Stream Protocol Format

Unlike the low-speed ATT_ADC data which is a single, fixed-size AdcData_TypeDef struct, the high-speed stream is a sequence of variable-length data chunks.

The analysis of FUN_1401184c0 reveals the following format for the high-speed stream:
Generated code

      
[Chunk 1: Varint Length] [Chunk 1: Data Payload] [Chunk 2: Varint Length] [Chunk 2: Data Payload] ...

    
Key Characteristics:

    Varint (Variable-Length Integer) Encoding: The function contains logic to decode a variable-length integer. This is a common technique in streaming protocols to efficiently encode the size of the following payload.

        If the length is less than 128 (0x80), it's encoded in a single byte.

        If it's larger, the most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is set to 1 to indicate that more bytes follow. The remaining 7 bits of each byte are part of the number.

Raw Data Payload: Following the Varint-encoded length is the actual data payload. The function then uses memcpy to copy this payload from the source buffer into a temporary buffer for further processing.
Generated c

      
// Copies the data payload of size 'iVar9'
memcpy((void *)(iVar8 + lVar3),local_48 + (iVar5 - iVar7),(longlong)iVar9);

    

Chunk-Based Processing: The function operates in a loop, processing one chunk at a time. After assembling a full chunk in its temporary buffer, it calls a function pointer to send the data onward. This is what you would expect for a function that is feeding a real-time chart.
Generated c

      
// This call sends the assembled chunk for processing
iVar2 = (**(code **)(*local_a0 + 0x18))
                  (local_a0,local_a8 + lVar3,uVar10 - local_a8,local_a8 + lVar14);



Comparison of Low-Speed vs. High-Speed Data
Feature	Low-Speed Real-time Data (ATT_ADC)	High-Speed Streamed Data (ATT_ADC_QUEUE)
Parsing Function	FUN_14015c9a0	FUN_1401184c0
Data Format	Single, fixed-size packet containing the AdcData_TypeDef struct.	A continuous stream of variable-length data chunks.
Structure	One header (MsgHeader_TypeDef) followed by one data payload (AdcData_TypeDef).	Each data payload is prefixed by a Varint-encoded length.
Use Case	Infrequent updates for dashboard display values.	High-frequency updates for populating the real-time chart/graph. This is the "long data package" stream.

Format of the High-Speed Data Chunks

The high-speed data is not sent as one massive packet, but as a continuous stream of smaller chunks. Each chunk follows a Length-Value format.

    Variable-Length Integer (Varint) for Length: The stream is prefixed with a Varint that encodes the length of the data payload that follows. This is a highly efficient way to frame variable-sized data.

        FUN_1401184c0 contains the logic to decode this: if the length is < 128, it's a single byte. If it's > 127, the MSB is set, and it continues reading bytes until one is found with the MSB cleared.

    Payload: A Sequence of VBUS/IBUS Sample Pairs: The data payload itself is a tightly packed sequence of VBUS and IBUS ADC readings. It does not contain the other fields like DP, DM, or Temperature.

How to Read the High-Speed Data Stream

To parse the stream of "long data packages," you must process it as a sequence of these chunks:

    Read the Varint Length (L): Read from the stream byte-by-byte to decode the variable-length integer L. This tells you how many bytes of sample data are in this chunk.

    Read the Payload: Read the next L bytes. This is your data payload.

    Process the Payload: The payload consists of L / 8 sample pairs. Iterate through the payload buffer, 8 bytes at a time. Each 8-byte segment is one sample point for the chart.

Format of a Single 8-Byte Sample Pair

Each 8-byte pair within the chunk's payload contains one VBUS and one IBUS reading, structured as follows:
Offset (within sample)	Length (bytes)	Data Field	Data Type (Little-Endian)	Unit (in Packet)	Scaling Factor (in App)	Final Unit
0 - 3	4	VBUS	int32_t	Microvolts (µV)	÷ 1,000,000	Volts (V)
4 - 7	4	IBUS	int32_t	Microamps (µA)	÷ 1,000,000	Amps (A)


The protocol documentation you provided is key here. The command to change the sample rate is not a unique command type, but rather a generic settings command that uses a specific attribute.

    From the enum attribute_data_type, we can see: ATT_SETTINGS = 0x008.

    This attribute is used to configure various device parameters, with the sample rate being one of the most important.

The Key Function: FUN_14012c170

The function responsible for handling this configuration is FUN_14012c170.

    Likely C++ Name: configureDevice, setSampleRate, or updateSettings.

    Role: This function is called when the user selects a new sample rate from the UI. It constructs and sends the command packet to the KM003Z to tell it how frequently it should send the high-speed data chunks.

How the Command is Sent and its Format

The process works as follows:

    UI Interaction: The user clicks a button (e.g., "1kSPS"). The application's UI code translates this selection into an integer value representing the desired samples per second (e.g., 1000).

    Function Call: This integer value is passed as a parameter to a function that ultimately calls FUN_14012c170. Let's assume the integer 1000 is passed in the param_6 argument of this function.

    Command Construction and Sending within FUN_14012c170:

        The function doesn't send just a simple command. It initiates a transaction that involves sending a settings command and likely waiting for an acknowledgment.

        The core of this is the construction of a command packet. The packet consists of:

            A 4-byte MsgHeader_TypeDef header.

            A payload containing the setting value.

    The Header (MsgHeader_TypeDef):

        head.ctrl.type would be set to a generic "set" command, such as CMD_SET_STATUS or a similar value that means "apply these attributes".

        head.ctrl.att would be set to ATT_SETTINGS (0x008).

    The Payload:

        The payload immediately follows the 4-byte header.

        It contains the integer value for the sample rate. For example, if the user selects "1kSPS", the application would send the integer 1000 (or 0x03E8 in hex) as the payload.

Evidence from the code in FUN_14012c170:

The function's logic is complex, but the key part involves a loop that seems to handle retries and acknowledgments. The central action is a virtual function call that represents sending data to the device:
Generated c

      
// Simplified logic from FUN_14012c170
// ...
do {
    if (*(char *)(param_1 + 0x3f) == '\0') {
        // This is a generic "write" or "send command" function call.
        // It's likely sending a command to set a parameter.
        iVar6 = (**(code **)(**(longlong **)(param_1 + 8) + 0x70))
                          (*(longlong **)(param_1 + 8), iVar10 + 3, 1);
    }
    // ...
} while ( ... some condition for retries ... );

if (iVar6 == 0) {
    // This section confirms the setting, possibly by writing the value.
    if (param_3 == 3) {
        // This call likely writes the actual sample rate value (e.g., 1000)
        // to the device's buffer/endpoint.
        iVar6 = (**(code **)(**(longlong **)(param_1 + 0x10) + 0x20))
                          (*(longlong **)(param_1 + 0x10), 0);
    }
}

 

This sequence indicates a "set parameter" operation. The application sends a command with the ATT_SETTINGS attribute, followed by the payload containing the new sample rate.
Conclusion

When you click a sample rate button in the UI:

    The application sends a command to the device.

    The command uses the attribute ATT_SETTINGS (0x008).

    The payload of this command contains the integer value of the desired sample rate (e.g., 1, 10, 50, 1000).

    The device firmware receives this command, reconfigures its internal ADC sampling timer, and begins sending the high-speed (VBUS, IBUS) data chunks at the newly requested rate.


Command: GetData with attribute: Unknown(6)

    Command: H->D F:1336 | 0c470600

        0c: CMD_GET_DATA

        47: Transaction ID 71

        0600: Attribute 0x0006 (le)

This command, GetData with attribute 0x0006, is a request for a combined, multi-sample, high-speed data packet. It's different from the standard AdcQueue and AdcQueue10k requests. Instead of just getting the latest ADC sample or a chunk of VBUS/IBUS pairs, this command asks for a "super-packet" containing multiple types of data at once.

Response: DataResponse with a large, composite payload

The device's response is a single, large packet that concatenates several different data structures.

    Response: D->H F:1338 | 41470209...

    Header: 41470209

        41: DataResponse

        47: Transaction ID 71 (matches the request)

        0209: Attribute 0x0902 (le). This is interesting. The device responds with a different attribute than was requested. The attribute 0x0902 is not defined in the provided enum, suggesting it's a composite or special response type.

    Payload:
    0180000b...

Let's break down this response payload based on the protocol documentation and the log data:

    First Part: AdcData_TypeDef (Low-Speed ADC Data)

        0180 000b 6c8c4d00 deffffff 0e8c4d00 00000000 148c4d00 5e000000 590c9b02 737e0000 00007d7e 0080a20c 00000000

        This is a complete AdcData_TypeDef struct, identical in format to the one you get from a standard ATT_ADC request. It provides a full snapshot of all current and averaged sensor readings.

    Second Part: High-Speed VBUS/IBUS Chunks

        Immediately following the AdcData_TypeDef struct is what appears to be data for the high-speed chart.

        0200 0505 c2923b00 ... 00000000

        This looks like the response to an AdcQueue or AdcQueue10k request, containing multiple pairs of VBUS/IBUS readings, likely framed with Varints. The 0200 0505 at the beginning is a strong indicator of a data header for a high-speed data block.

Conclusion and Interpretation

The command GetData with attribute 0x0006 is a request for a combined "sync" packet.

Instead of the PC having to send two separate commands—one to poll for the dashboard values (ATT_ADC) and another to poll for the high-speed chart data (ATT_ADC_QUEUE)—this single command requests both in one go.

The device responds with a single, larger packet that is a concatenation of:

    A standard AdcData_TypeDef payload (for updating dashboard UI elements).

    One or more high-speed data chunks (for updating the real-time chart).

The relevant part of the qt_metacall dispatch table in FUN_140159200 is likely case 0xd or a similar one that triggers a virtual function call to send the data request.
Generated c

      
// Inside FUN_140159200
// ...
case 0xd:
  // This is a virtual function call that ultimately sends the command.
  // The exact command (0x0c) and attribute (0x0002, 0x0004, or 0x0006)
  // are determined by the application's internal state (e.g., SPS setting).
  (**(code **)(*(longlong *)param_1 + 0x178))(param_1); 
  return;
// ...

    



    The application determines which attribute to send based on the selected sample rate. While the 1 SPS and 50 SPS logs show requests for AdcQueue (0x0002), it's highly probable that selecting a higher rate (or a specific mode) causes this function to send a request with attribute 0x0006 instead, to get the combined data more efficiently.

Function that Processes the Combined Response

The function responsible for parsing the large, concatenated response packet is FUN_14015bbb0.

    Likely C++ Name: processDataResponse or handlePacket.

    Role: This function acts as a "meta-parser." It inspects the header of an incoming DataResponse packet and, based on the attribute, delegates the parsing of the payload to the correct specialized function.

    Evidence:
    This function is called by FUN_14015aee0 (likely QosClient::onDataReceived), which is the central dispatch for incoming data. FUN_14015bbb0 is the logical next step for handling a packet once it's identified as a data response.

    When it receives the response to the 0x0006 request (which has a header of 41 xx 02 09), it performs the following steps:

        Check Attribute: It reads the header and sees the attribute 0x0902. It has specific logic to handle this composite packet type.

        Parse the AdcData_TypeDef Part: It takes the first 52 bytes of the payload and passes them to FUN_14015c9a0 (the same function used for low-speed ATT_ADC data) to parse the SensorDataPacket and update the dashboard values.

        Parse the High-Speed Chunk Part: It takes the rest of the payload (from byte 52 onwards) and passes it to FUN_1401184c0 (the high-speed stream parser) to be processed as a stream of (VBUS, IBUS) sample pairs for the chart.

This delegation is crucial. The application intelligently reuses its existing parsers to handle the different parts of the composite packet.
Summary Table
Task	Sending Function	Processing Function
Request Combined Data	FUN_140159200 (likely requestDataTick)	N/A
Process Combined Data	N/A	FUN_14015bbb0 (the "meta-parser") which then calls:<br>1. FUN_14015c9a0 on the first 52 bytes.<br>2. FUN_1401184c0 on the remaining bytes.

All of these key functions (FUN_140159200, FUN_14015bbb0, FUN_14015c9a0, and FUN_1401184c0) are present in the export_3.txt file you provided. Your analysis was spot-on; the high-speed data stream uses a more complex, optimized protocol, and the code reflects this with specialized sending and processing logic.

// note from AI doing part 1: 
 Clarifying the Sample Rate Command (Suggestion for "part 3" analysis):

    The analysis of how to change the sample rate is correct. It's not a unique command but a generic "Set" command where the attribute is ATT_SETTINGS (0x008) and the payload is the integer value of the desired sample rate (e.g., 1000 for 1kSPS).

    Synthesis: This command is sent by the PC to the device to tell it how frequently to generate the high-speed data chunks. A higher rate results in more chunks per second being sent over USB.
