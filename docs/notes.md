looks like the protocol uses AES-128.

the keys are in **get_crypto_key** function

functions to take a look at:
-
- FUN_1401611a0, FUN_140161180
-
  ```
  Address	Old Name	Signal Index	Parameters	New Name	Likely Purpose
  FUN_140161250	emit_device_ready_signal	0	None	signal_deviceReady	Fired after the USB device is opened and claimed.

  FUN_1401611d0	(new)	2	int errorCode	signal_errorOccurred	Fired when a USB transaction fails.
  FUN_140161210	emit_transaction_finished_signal	3	None	signal_transactionFinished	Fired after any command sequence completes.
  FUN_1401611a0	(new)	4	QByteArray data	signal_dataReady	Fired when new data arrives from the device.

- small subset of functionality is availabe via virtual serial port, tested, works. needs to enter full command at once, typing manually per symbol doesn't work for some reason
	- ah, look like in desktop software the virtual serial port is used only for protocol trigger?
	- yes, they have like a separate app that connects to that vcomm, and the interface is cursed
